# BPM Platform Architecture

## Overview

The BPM Platform is built using a microservices architecture, designed for scalability, maintainability, and reliability.

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - React.js application
   - Redux for state management
   - BPMN.io for process modeling
   - Material-UI for components

2. **Backend Services**
   - Process Management Service
   - User Management Service
   - Task Management Service
   - Notification Service
   - Analytics Service

3. **Data Layer**
   - MongoDB for main data storage
   - Redis for caching
   - MinIO for file storage

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Docker containers
   - Kubernetes orchestration
   - Nginx reverse proxy
   - Let's Encrypt SSL

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - OAuth2 integration
   - MFA support

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Resource-level permissions
   - API gateway security

3. **Data Security**
   - End-to-end encryption
   - At-rest encryption
   - Secure communication (TLS)

## Scalability

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless services
   - Load balancing
   - Database sharding

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategy
   - Database indexing
   - CDN integration

## Monitoring & Logging

1. **Monitoring**
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Health checks

2. **Logging**
   - Centralized logging
   - Error tracking
   - Audit trails

## Deployment Architecture

1. **Environments**
   - Development
   - Staging
   - Production

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Automated testing
   - Container builds
   - Blue-green deployments

## Integration Architecture

1. **External Systems**
   - REST APIs
   - Webhook support
   - Message queues

2. **Internal Communication**
   - gRPC
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Service mesh
